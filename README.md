# user-registration-validation
This project demonstrates a User Registration Validation API developed using MuleSoft 4. The API validates incoming request payload fields such as name, email, and role using MuleSoft Validation components (is-not-null, is-email, is-true). Proper HTTP 400 Bad Request responses are returned for invalid inputs using centralized error handling.
